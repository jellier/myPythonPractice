I think I will use "markdown" and I don't remember how to use this 
So I put some example for myself,bingo.


### For example:
#### Header:
A First Level Header
====================
# Another First Level Header
A Second Level Header
---------------------
## Another Second Level Header
### A Third Level Header

#### br:
> If you need a break by"br", you'd better end a line with two or more space , then type return.   

#### Blockquotes:
> Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:  

> This is the first level of quoting.
> 1.   This is the first list item.
> 2.   This is the second list item.
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

#### crossed out
> ~~this is crossed out~~

#### list:
> 1. Bird
> 2. McHale
> 3. Parish

> * red
> * blue
> * green

> + fish
> + bird
> + insect

> - dad
> - mom
> - brother

> - [ ] incomplete 1
> - [ ] incomplete 2
> - [x] completed

#### code block:

<pre><code>
This is a code block.<br/>
alert("hello world!")
</code></pre>
#### table:
> This is a regular paragraph.  
> The next is a table.
> <table>
>     <tr>
>         <td>Foo</td>
>     </tr>
> </table>
> This is another regular paragraph.

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

#### link:
> <http://example.com/>  
> [aliyun](http://www.aliyun.com)    
> <jellier@163.com>  
> This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.  

> I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

>   [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
>   [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
>   [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

#### horizontal:
* * *
